# Uber-for-X driver & customer apps using HyperTrack SDK

**ðŸ›‘WARNING: THIS SAMPLE APPLICATION IS DEPRECATED - IT ISN'T WORKING. WE'RE WORKING ON AN IMPROVED PLATFORM AND PLAN TO UPDATE THIS REPO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.**

[Please cast your vote](https://hypertrack.canny.io/feature-requests/p/update-sample-apps-to-new-v3-architecture) if you would like to use this sample app and we'll prioritize it accordingly.

-------

Uberâ€™s business model has given rise to a large number of Uber-for-X services. Among other things, X equals moving, parking, courier, groceries, flowers, alcohol, dog walks, massages, dry cleaning, vets, medicines, car washes, roadside assistance and marijuana. Through these on-demand platforms, supply and demand are aggregated online for services to be fulfilled offline.

This open source repo/s uses HyperTrack SDK for developing real world Uber-like consumer & driver apps.

 - **Uber-for-X Consumer app** can be used by customer to :
      - Login/signup customer using Firebase phone-number authentication
      - Show available cars near customer's current location
      - Allow customer to select pickup and dropoff location
      - Show estimated fare and route for selected pickup and dropoff location
      - Book a ride from desired pickup and dropoff location
      - Track driver to customer's pickup location
      - Track the ongoing ride to dropoff location
      - Let customers share live trip with friends and family
      - Show trip summary with distance travelled
